- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryce. My secret coding YouTube channel is- hatu: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC93Fc7x4XsEnyUz7gMDet1Q
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in math and physics.<br /><br />
If you are one of the only people to ever see my profile, congratulations! (I don't know how you found me lol)<br />
I mostly like to express math concepts with code. I am a mechanical engineering student at Pitt.<br />
I taught myself to code when I was younger, so I really don't know any proper techniques or code formatting. It's all written in Bryce methods which stay pretty consistent. <br />
I just imagine GitHub as my online flash drive that I can keep my homework solvers on.<br />
I don't upload any of my Arduino, C, MATLAB, Mathematica, or Processing stuff on here because they're all very specific applications and don't really have a use to be on here.
