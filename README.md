- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryce.<br />
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in math and physics.<br /><br />
I mostly like to express math concepts with code. I am a mechanical engineering student at Pitt.<br />
I taught myself to code when I was younger, so I really don't know any proper techniques or code formatting. It's all written in Bryce methods which stay pretty consistent. <br />
This is basically my online flash drive that I can keep frequently used programs on.<br />
I don't upload any of my Arduino, C, MATLAB, Mathematica, or Processing stuff on here because they're all very specific applications and don't really have a use to be on here.
